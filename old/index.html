      <h1 class="header">Welcome back golfers</h1>
      <p>Every Labor Day morning, the gallant alumni of Covington Latin School meet at Hartwell Golf Club and brave the conditions, both of weather and of golf course, to produce another chapter in Classic lore. This tradition, began in MCMXIX A.D., always commences with a 9am commissioner’s tee-off and concludes with the presenting of accolades at our beloved Hartwell Frisch’s Big Boy. What will happen in this year’s Classic? No one is ever certain, but if you don’t show, you won’t know. Thanks for visiting the site, and may the power lines be ever in your favor. </p>

        <li>Congratulations to our 2016 champion Jon Massey! Jon 1st championship was hard-fought and well-earned. With a low net of 27, he has set himself up for success for 2017 and beyond.</li>
        <li>Labor Day 2017 = September 4th. Don’t forget.</li>
        <li>Weather looks like weather. It could be sunny, could be rainy. It is inconsequential.</li>
